        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, melted butter, egg, and vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; it's okay if the batter is slightly lumpy.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly greased griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>For each pancake, pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle.</li>
            <li>Cook until bubbles form on the surface of the pancake and the edges begin to look set, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Flip the pancake and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until golden brown on both sides.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the remaining batter, greasing the griddle as needed.</li>
            <li>Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings, such as maple syrup, fresh fruit, or whipped cream.</li>
        </ol>
